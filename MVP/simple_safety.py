Assuming that the goal of the attack is to kill the maximum number of people, the most lethal weapons would be those that can cause the most damage over the widest area in the shortest amount of time. 

Some of the most lethal weapons in this category would be nuclear weapons, which can cause widespread destruction over a large area, and biological weapons, which can cause a large number of people to become sick or die in a short period of time."""):
